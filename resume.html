    <!--So I'm not sure how I would use the article tag in my resume, I think I would use it when I create my website and have to include different examples of graphic design projects I have done like magazines, branding, etc...., but in the instructions it seems like it says I have to include the article tag in this project, so this is my attempt at it.-->
    <!--The reason why I used the article tag there is because the links to my samples articles are after the Distraction Magazine section since I wrote those articles for the magazine and if someone were looking at my resume and saw that I worked at Distraction then they probably want to see samples of my writing. However, my writing samples could also go in a different area cause they can stand alone and the audience would still understand why I included writing samples.-->
    <!--I followed the format from the textbook-->
